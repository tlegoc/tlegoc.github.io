      Hi, I'm Théo ! I'm a 22 years old student in software engineering from France with a passion for 3D graphics and game engine development. **I am looking for an internship in the field of game engine development !**
      Currently in Québec studying at UQAC, I am in my last year of my CS degree at ESIR, with a major in video games and digital imaging.
      I enjoy various types of games, but I like challenges and good stories, and I hope I'll be able to work on a game that will impact people as much as other game impacted me.
